# Workflow Details

This section describes the Autoafids workflow (i.e. steps taken to produce 
intermediate and final files). Autoafids is a 
[Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) workflow, and thus a 
directed acyclic graph (DAG) that is automatically configured based on a set of 
rules.
